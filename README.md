> Pure JSON Specification Compiler: `(structure, data) -> Spec JSON`

## The Mental Model: The Food & The Recipe

In application architecture, transforming data should never involve arbitrary scripts mutating objects in place.

Think of it this way:

- **`structure.json` is the Food**: Raw, untouched source data coming from an external client, database, or API (such as Tally or SAP).
- **`data.json` is the Recipe**: The declarative transformation instructions specifying which keys to alter, which branches to drill into, and how to reshape the output.
- **`json-transformer` is the Kitchen**: It takes the food, reads the recipe, and produces the final dish without ever touching or modifying the original ingredients.

```
       structure.json (The Food)           data.json (The Recipe)

                               Result JSON

## Why Two Separate JSONs? The Immutability Principle

Developers often ask: *"Why maintain two separate files? Why not embed transformation directives directly into the source JSON?"*

There is a fundamental architectural reason:

1. **Client Data Must Remain Sacrosanct**:
   Source data belongs to the external producer (client, upstream service, database). You do not own it. Mutating it in place corrupts original caches and introduces unintended side-effects.

2. **Preventing Infinite Loops**:
   If you modify the source object while recursively traversing it, the traversal engine can easily get caught in infinite recursion loops.

3. **Separation of Concerns**:
   The data changes dynamically on every request. The recipe changes only when your business contract evolves. Keeping them separated creates a clean, deterministic pipeline.

## How It Works: The Traversal Pipeline

Under the hood in `v8`, the traversal follows a strict, predictable sequence:

### 1. Central Dispatcher (`traverse.js`)
The engine inspects the input:
- If it is an Array ➔ delegates to `traverseArray`.
- If it is an Object ➔ delegates to `traverseObject`.
- Otherwise ➔ returns the primitive as-is.

### 2. The Decision Point in `traverseObject` (Line 14 Rule)
The engine checks the **Recipe**, not the source:

```javascript
if (localRecipe && typeof localRecipe === "object" && "transform" in localRecipe) {
    newElement = ifTransformFound({
        inSource: localSource,
        inTransform: localRecipe.transform
    });
}
```

The engine queries the recipe: *"Do you have instructions for this level?"* If `"transform"` exists, it delegates to `ifTransformFound`.

### 3. Iteration in `ifTransformFound`
Here, the roles flip:
- `localSource` becomes the **Source of Truth** that drives the loop (`Object.entries(localSource)`).
- `localTransform` acts strictly as the **Lookup Table** for instructions.

For every key in `localSource`:
- If the key is not in `localTransform`, it is ignored.
- If the key has directives:
  - `alterKey`: Renames the key on the output object.
  - `transform`: Recursively invokes `traverse` on nested values.
  - `valueType: "array"`: Ensures the output is an array.
  - `valueKey`: Extracts a specific child property value.

## Quickstart

```bash
npm install @keshavsoft/json-transformer
```

```javascript
import transform from "@keshavsoft/json-transformer";

const source = {
    STOCKITEM: [
        {
            BASEUNITS: { "#text": "kgs", "@_TYPE": "String" },
            NAME: "Item A"
        }
    ]
};

const recipe = {
    transform: {
        STOCKITEM: {
            alterKey: "StockItems",
            transform: {
                BASEUNITS: { alterKey: "Units", valueKey: "#text" },
                NAME: { alterKey: "Name" }
            }
        }
    }
};

const result = transform(source, recipe);
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "StockItems": [
    {
      "Units": "kgs",
      "Name": "Item A"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Directives Reference

| Directive | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `alterKey` | `string` | Renames the key in the transformed output. |
| `transform` | `object` | Specifies nested transformation rules for children. |
| `valueKey` | `string` | Unwraps a specific child property from an object (e.g. `"#text"`). |
| `valueType` | `"array"` | Guarantees the output value is wrapped in an array. |

## Architecture (`src/v8/`)

```

├── traverse.js               # Central recursive dispatcher
├── traverseObject/
│   └── index.js              # Object handler: checks recipe for transform

```

- **Zero comments**: Code intent is conveyed entirely through folder structure and naming.
- **Strict In-Local convention**: Parameter unpacking is strictly internal.
- **Zero dependencies**: Pure, deterministic JavaScript.
